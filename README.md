# Numerical solution of systems of linear equations 
It is necessary to implement three methods of solving a system of linear algebraic equations:
1. Gauss method.
i. To get the maximum score, you need to implement not in the form of "naive
method of exclusion of variables", and in matrix form (LU decomposition), LU decomposition),
necessarily with the selection of the main element.
2. Jacobi method.
3. Seidel's method.od
